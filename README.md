- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @joannamckenzie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science and analytics.
- I work for The Data Lab Scotland.

I don't have much of a profile here because most of the things I work on are confidential -- mostly in the sense that the data are shared under non-disclosure agreements.

I work mostly in python these days but in the past I've used all sorts of coding languages including java, R, matlab, ruby, perl and even fortran. I'm pretty good with databases
especially mysql although I've also used mongodb and neo4j recently.
